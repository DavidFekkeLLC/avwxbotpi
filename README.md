# AVWX Bot for the Raspberry Pi

I wrote this bot to check the weather every 15 minutes. The `AIRPORT` env variable contains the four character ICAO code for the airport you choose. It is designed to run over a home network on a Raspberry Pi running Node.js version 16.

This script talks to a Hue light bulb over the Hue bridge. It requires two environment variables, one for the `IP_ADDRESS`, and one for the username or `USERTOKEN`. 

Hue provides instructions on how to get the whitelisted username from the following [web page](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/).

Please star this if you like.
